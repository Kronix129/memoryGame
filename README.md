-This is my implementation of a memory game through JavaScript, displayed under games on my website. 
- It implements DOM manipulation through vanilla JS and JQuery.

Users choose two squares that they think will match, if they match the user will receive one point and the squares will remain unrevealed. If squares do not match, they are revealed once again.

- Wait for transitioning periods when selecting a new square/option. There is a half a second delay time when choosing your next choice, this is implemented to prevent spam selection of squares which breaks the game.
- Very rarely the transitioning between revealed and non revealed squares or vise versa may be a little quicker than normal, not 100% sure of this reasoning but I'm thinking it's due to a bit of input or browser lag.
- The game is created via Responsive Web Design, therefore it should scale to any browser size/screen size that is being used.
- Play on 80% - 90% zoom for the best experience.
