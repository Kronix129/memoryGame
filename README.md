# memoryGame
This is my implementation of a memory game through java script. Users choose two squares that they think will match, if they match the user will receive one point and the squares will remain unrevealed. If squares do not match, they are revealed once again.
- Wait for transitioning periods when selecting a new square/option. The game will not work correctly if squares are clicked in quick succession. ie wait for the square to fully fade out before selecting a new choice.
- Occassionally the transitioning between revealed and non revealed squares or vise versa may be a little quicker than normal, not 100% sure of this reasoning but I'm thinking it's due to a bit of input or browser lag.
